As a user 
When i visit a website coin flip game 
I see a coin and a button that say's Flip coin and coin flip counter


As a user 
When I click the flip coin button 
The coin should spin for 3 seconds
Then coin should stop spinning and will display one side of coin (Heads or tails)
And our the coin flip counter should increase by 1
